Question to discuss
  - Locker size
        - Will every locker be of the same size?
        - Is there any size restriction on an item that can be kept in the locker?
  - Locker selection
        - How will the system make sure that multiple customers do not get the same locker?
        - Will the customer choose the locker of his own choice, or will the system assign him a locker based on availability?
        - Can a customer get two lockers for different orders at the same time?
        - Will the system keep in mind the locker and package sizes while assigning the locker to the customer?
  - Locker status
        - Is there any time constraint on the package that can be kept in the locker?
        - What will happen if the customer does not come to pick up his package within the valid time period?
  - Returning an item
        - Can the customer return an item through the Amazon Locker service?
        - If yes, will they get the same locker from which they picked up the item?
        - How will the locker be assigned to the customer while returning an item?

Requirement collection
  Following are the expectations from the system:
      - Person asks the system to allocate a locker for a given package. Assume random allocation for now. The system should be extensible and accommodate allocation of locker based on the size of the input package
      - The system must generate a code/otp and send it to the user along with the locker details
      - The user can enter the otp & locker details to unlock the locker
      - Once the package is taken out, the locker can be allocated for any other order
      - Users can use the locker for returning an item. OTP/code will be sent to the delivery person in this case
      - Operations/Admin can view & vacate all lockers which are in use for more than 3 days

  Evaluation criteria:
      - Code readability
      - Extensibility & re-usability
      - Modularity
      - Testability
